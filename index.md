Hi 👋 <em>whoever_is_reading_this</em>,

Welcome to my website!🙏

I want to use this page as a tool to showcase my projects and ideas. Here's some info about me,
I am working in the ASIC industry as a silicon validation engineer (still a beginner).
I write firmware for testing & validation of in-house IP and SoC.
I am working in the data storage industry, specifically on the high-speed host interface protocols.

Have a great day!🎉
