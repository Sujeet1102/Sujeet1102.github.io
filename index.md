Hi, 👋

Welcome to my webpage! 🙏

I want to use this page as a tool to showcase my projects and ideas. Here's some info about me,  
I am working in the ASIC industry as a silicon validation engineer (still a beginner).  
I write firmware for testing & validation of the in-house IP and the SoCs.  
I am working in the data storage industry, specifically on the high-speed host interface protocols.  

Have a great day! 🎉
